## How it works

This is a simple synthesized time-to-digital converter (TDC), consisting of a delay line ring and parallel capture FF. Depending on `__TDC_INTERLEAVED__` either a simple or an interleaved delay line is implemented.

## How to test

Apply two signals to `ui_in[0]` and `clk`.

After capturing (rising edge of `clk`) the result (i.e., the time delay between rising edge of `ui_in[0]` and `clk`) can be muxed-out to `uo_out[7:0]` using `ui_in[7:3]` as byte-wise selector. `ui_in[7:3]=0000` gives result byte 0, `ui_in[7:3]=0001` gives result byte 1, etc.

## External hardware

Two signal generators generating logical signals with a programmable delay.
